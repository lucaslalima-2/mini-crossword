# mini-crossword

# SETUP
* make setup
* source venv/bin/activate

Note: Haven't figured out a way to enable this on macOS. MacOS does not leverage the Tcl foundation that tkinter is built on.
Simply put, this app incompatible with macOS at the moment.

# USAGE
* To see full extent of my code, I suggest running: 
   * make debug
* This will load a board identical to the one seen in example_crossword.png
